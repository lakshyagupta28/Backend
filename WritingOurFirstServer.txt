  Let us understand what is a SERVER?


  Our browser converts the request to an address and it is sent to the ISP and then ISP returns the file 
  to the our computer and website is displayed.

  
                  
                  Opens a TCP/IS connection
                  via socket. Request for the 
                  document.                        
       Computer  ------------------------->  Server
                 <-------------------------
                  
                 Wait for the reply, once it gets
                 the reply the socket is closed.

  Lets dive into coding:-

  index.js has the created server and the package.json is the created server

  So far we have created a blank server that has no response, lets now create server with a response-

  Reading and serving the HTML page from a file
  And installing Nodemon (Node Monitor) that takes care for restarting the server


  Extending to Multiple Pages
